# üöÄ Welcome to MyShell: A Custom Linux Shell Implementation

## Overview

MyShell is a custom Linux Shell Implementation written in C, providing basic shell functionality with support for various command execution modes, built-in commands, I/O redirection, piping, and background process management.

## Features

### Built-in Commands
- üìÅ `cd`: Change current directory
- ‚ùì `help`: Display help information
- ‚ùå `exit`: Exit the shell

### Advanced Functionality
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **I/O Redirection**
  - Input redirection: `command < input_file`
  - Output redirection: `command > output_file`
- ‚è´ **Pipe Support**: `command1 | command2`
- üåê **Background Process Execution**: `command &`

## Compilation and Building

The compilation and execution are handled through the `Makefile`. 

Simply run: **`make`**

This command compiles the source code and automatically runs the shell.

### Makefile

The provided `Makefile` automates the compilation and execution process:

- **`make`**: Compiles the source code and runs the shell.
- **`make clean`**: Removes the compiled `MyShell` executable.

## Shell Behavior

### Command Processing
1. Supports complex command parsing
2. Handles up to 256 arguments per command
3. Supports input and output redirection
4. Enables piping between commands
5. Allows background process execution

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions
- `getCurrDir()`: Retrieves and updates current working directory
- `parseInput()`: Tokenizes user input into arguments
- `runCommands()`: Executes commands with various processing modes
- `setupPipe()`: Manages command piping
- `runBackgroundCommand()`: Handles background process execution

### Process Management
- Uses `fork()` for creating child processes
- Implements zombie process reaping
- Supports safe process creation and termination

### Commands Implemented with sample examples

 - `Change directory`: cd MyFolder

 - `List files`: ls

 - `Show all available commands `: help
 
 - `Input Redirection`:cat < input.txt
 
 - `Output Redirection`: ls > files.txt

 - `Piping`: ls | grep .txt

 - `Background command execution`: long_running_script &

#### Process Tree Visualization

![Process Tree Visualization](Pstree_Visualization.png "Process Tree")

This shows:
- **bash (PID 15378)**: This represents my terminal shell.
- **make (PID 15477)**: A child process of bash responsible for building or compiling something.
- **MyShell (PID 15483)**: Another child process of bash.This is my custom shell.
- **sh (PID 17629)**: A child process created by MyShell.
- **pstree (PID 17630)**: A child process created by sh to generate the process tree visualization.

The process tree demonstrates that the custom shell is effectively managing and creating child processes as required.


## Error Handling
- Provides descriptive error messages
- Handles various potential failure scenarios
- Safe process management
